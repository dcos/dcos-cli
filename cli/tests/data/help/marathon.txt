Description:
    The Mesosphere Datacenter Operating System (DC/OS) spans all of the machines in
your datacenter or cloud and treats them as a single, shared set of resources.

Usage:
    dcos [options] [<command>] [<args>...]

Options:
    --debug
        Enable debug mode.
    --help
        Print usage.
    --log-level=<log-level>
        Set the logging level. This setting does not affect the output sent to
        stdout. The severity levels are:
        The severity level:
        * debug    Prints all messages.
        * info     Prints informational, warning, error, and critical messages.
        * warning  Prints warning, error, and critical messages.
        * error    Prints error and critical messages.
        * critical Prints only critical messages to stderr.
    --version
        Print version information
    --service-name=<service-name>
        Sets the non-default name of the service to invoke request against.
        For example if marathon is installed to invoke `dcos marathon`
        commands with the default installation invoke
        `dcos --service-name=marathon-user marathon`

Environment Variables:
    DCOS_CONFIG
        Set the path to the DC/OS configuration file. By default, this variable
        is set to ~/.dcos/dcos.toml.
    DCOS_DEBUG
        Indicates whether to print additional debug messages to stdout. By
        default this is set to false.
    DCOS_LOG_LEVEL
        Prints log messages to stderr at or above the level indicated. This is
        equivalent to the --log-level command-line option.
    DCOS_SERVICE_NAME
      Sets the service name to be used for commands that invoked against a
      service endpoint.  Otherwise it has no effect.
