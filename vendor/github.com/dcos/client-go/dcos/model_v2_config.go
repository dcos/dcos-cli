// * If a default is not set, then it will be left empty, even for objects. * Set defaults in the object that is furthest from the root object. * Always set a default for arrays. * The purpose of \"x-nullable\" is to allow the output JSON field to be set   to the golang \"zero value\". Without \"x-nullable\", the field will be   removed altogether from the resulting JSON. * Actual validation is done in the code, not expressed in swagger. * Since an empty boolean is interpreted as \"false\", don't set   a default. * CamelCase * Swagger will only do enum validation if it is a top level definition!
